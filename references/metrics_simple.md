Technical Inventory: PRIO Offshore Logistics Operations & Infrastructure (Metrics-Only)

1. Logistics Network & Physical Infrastructure Nodes

The spatial architecture of PRIO’s Campos Basin operations is anchored by a high-efficiency hub-and-spoke model, where the Port of Macaé (22°23'S, 41°47'W) functions as the central nervous system. This strategic positioning minimizes transit-time-to-node for critical supply runs, ensuring the continuity of the subsea tieback clusters and production facilities through a centralized shore-base infrastructure.

Port of Macaé (BRMEA) Technical Specifications

Shore-base operations are constrained by maritime parameters that dictate the displacement and LOA (Length Overall) of the serving fleet.

Technical Parameter	Specification
Maximum Draught	7.9 meters
Maximum Vessel Length (LOA)	97 meters
Deadweight Capacity (DWT)	5,513 tonnes
Total Turnaround Time	6–12 hours (Average: 8 hours)
Operating Hours	24/7

Operational Phase Durations

* Atracação (Berthing/Setup): 30–60 minutes (±15 min variability).
* Liquid Cargo Loading: 2–4 hours (Rate: 100–200 m³/h).
* Dry Bulk Loading: 1–3 hours (Pneumatic Rate: 50–100 m³/h).
* Deck Cargo Loading: 3–6 hours (15–30 minutes per lift).
* Documentação (Clearance): 30–60 minutes.

Nautical Distance Matrix

The logistics network involves direct transit from Macaé and inter-node movements to optimize load consolidation.

Destination/Route	Distance (NM)	Transit Time @ 12 knots	Transit Time @ 14 knots
Macaé → FPSO Peregrino	46 NM	3.8 hours	3.3 hours
Macaé → FPSO Valente (Frade)	67 NM	5.6 hours	4.8 hours
Macaé → Polvo / FPSO Bravo	70 NM	5.8 hours	5.0 hours
Macaé → FPSO Forte (Albacora Leste)	75 NM	6.3 hours	5.4 hours
Peregrino ↔ Polvo	15 NM	1.3 hours	1.1 hours
Polvo ↔ FPSO Bravo	5.9 NM	0.5 hours	0.4 hours

Node Characteristics: Primary Offshore Installations

Installation	Region/Location	Water Depth	Production Capacity
FPSO Bravo (Tubarão Martelo)	Southern Campos	121 m	Cluster Hub (Polvo-TBMT)
FPSO Valente (Frade)	Northern Campos	1,200 m	100,000 bpd (Processing)
FPSO Forte (Albacora Leste)	Northern Campos	400–1,500 m	180,000 bpd (Processing)
FPSO Peregrino	85 km Offshore	120 m	110,000 bpd (Processing)
Platform Polvo A	Southern Campos	121 m	Wellhead Platform (Fixed)

Fixed asset nodes require consistent servicing by a mobile fleet capable of high-frequency replenishment.

2. Heterogeneous Vessel Fleet: Technical Specifications & Performance

PRIO utilizes a $100M Solstad Offshore partnership to maintain a heterogeneous fleet, mitigating operational downtime and supporting complex subsea projects. This mix of standard and specialized vessels allows for simultaneous routine supply and heavy subsea construction (e.g., Wahoo-Frade tieback).

Comparative Vessel Class Profiles

Specification	Vessel Class 1 (UT 755)	Vessel Class 2 (UT 874 / PX 121)
LOA (Length)	71.9 m	85.0 – 91.4 m
Beam	16.0 m	18.0 – 18.3 m
Draught (Loaded)	5.7 m	5.8 – 6.5 m
Clear Deck Area	900 – 1,000 m²	1,040 – 1,200 m²
Deck Cargo Capacity	2,450 tonnes	2,800 – 3,200 tonnes

Specialized Fleet Capabilities

* CSV Normand Pioneer: Critical for Wahoo and Albacora Leste tieback projects; features a 100–250 tonne crane and subsea capabilities including trenching and flexible pipe-laying.
* WSV Normand Carioca: Specialized Well Stimulation Vessel supporting drilling activities and completion; currently dedicated to the Bacalhau field operations (Equinor) under the broader contract umbrella.

Fuel Consumption Benchmark

Consumption rates are calculated in tonnes per day (Marine Gas Oil).

Operational Mode	Standard PSV	Large PSV	CSV (Specialized)
Transit	15 – 18 t/day	18 – 22 t/day	20 – 30 t/day
Standby / DP	3 – 5 t/day	4 – 7 t/day	8 – 12 t/day
Port	2 – 3 t/day	2 – 4 t/day	N/A

Hardware capacity is strictly allocated to the transport of liquid and dry bulk cargo types.

3. Cargo Catalog & Inbound Demand Dynamics

Inbound logistics are managed to sustain inventory above ANP-mandated safety stock levels, specifically 48 hours for Diesel Fuel and 36 hours for Fresh Water.

Liquid Bulk Specification Table

Cargo Type	Density (kg/m³)	Typical Volume	Segregation Requirement
Diesel Fuel	850	200 – 800 m³	Required; 4h cleaning for water
Fresh Water	1,000	300 – 600 m³	Critical; incompatible with all
OBM/WBM (Mud)	1,100 – 1,400	400 – 1,000 m³	6h cleaning OBM to WBM
Methanol	792	100 – 400 m³	Critical; 8h cleaning required

Dry Bulk & Deck Cargo Requirements

* Barite Alert: High-density cargo (2,500–4,200 kg/m³); transfer and vessel loading are limited by weight, not volume.
* Pneumatic Transfer: Rates of 50–100 m³/h for Cement and Barite.
* Lifting Constraints: Deck operations cease at wind speeds > 15 m/s or Significant Wave Height (Hs) > 2.5 m.
* Casing & Drill Pipes: 40 ft sections; typically 200–800 tonnes per trip.

Weekly Demand Profiles

* Bravo / Polvo Cluster: Diesel (500 m³), Water (400 m³), Deck Cargo (150 tonnes).
* Valente / Wahoo Cluster: Diesel (350 m³), Water (250 m³), Oil-Based Mud (800 m³) during Wahoo campaign.
* FPSO Forte: Diesel (500 m³), Water (400 m³), Deck Cargo (200 tonnes).
* Peregrino Complex: Diesel (800 m³), Water (600 m³), Deck Cargo (340 tonnes).

Inbound supply logistics directly enable the maintenance of outbound production and revenue cycles.

4. Production Output & Outbound Export Metrics

PRIO's clustering strategy, highlighted by the 30km Wahoo-Frade subsea tieback, optimizes outbound logistics by centralizing production through existing FPSO infrastructure.

Production Capacity Snapshot (2025/2026)

Asset	Expected Production (bpd)	Oil Gravity (API)
Frade / Wahoo	~78,000	20 – 25° (Medium)
Albacora Leste	~22,000	~20° (Medium)
Peregrino	~100,000	14° (Heavy)
Polvo / TBMT	~10,800	25° (Leve)

Offloading & Export Metrics

* FPSO Valente: 1.6 million barrel storage; typical offload frequency of 30–35 days (at 50% level) using Suezmax tankers.
* FPSO Forte: 1+ million barrel storage; 248,520 DWT storage capacity; processing hub for marginal tiebacks.
* FPSO Bravo: ~600,000 barrel storage; offload frequency every 45–50 days.
* Porto do Açu Ship-to-Ship (STS): Facilitates heavy oil transshipment to VLCCs; supported by a 110,000 bpd agreement with Cathay Petroleum.

Steady-state production is vulnerable to MetOcean constraints that disrupt the logistics cycle.

5. Environmental Constraints & Operational Workability

Campos Basin MetOcean data identifies Significant Wave Height (Hs) as the dominant limit for logistics uptime.

Workability Matrix

Operation Type	Maximum Hs (m)	Maximum Wind (m/s)
Vessel Transit	4.5 m	30 m/s
Approach (Aproximação)	3.0 m	20 m/s
Liquid Discharge	3.0 m	18 m/s
Crane / Deck Ops	2.5 m	15 m/s
Dry Bulk Discharge	2.5 m	15 m/s

Seasonal Weather Distribution (Uptime Frequency)

* Verão (Summer): Good (<2m) 65–70%; Severe (>4m) 3–5%.
* Inverno (Winter): Good (<2m) 40–50%; Severe (>4m) 10–15%.
* Transição (Apr-May, Sep-Nov): Good (<2m) 55–60%; Moderate (2-3m) standard average.

Weather Delay Impact

Logistical operations face a 10–15% delay frequency based on a Lognormal distribution. Delays average 4–8 hours, though severe frontal systems can exceed 48 hours.

Environmental downtime translates directly into high-magnitude economic penalties.

6. Cost Architecture & Economic Penalties

In the PRIO network, the cost of logistical delivery is a marginal expense compared to the severe financial loss of production downtime.

Charter & Operating Costs (USD)

Vessel/Item	Daily Rate / Price
Standard PSV	$8,000 – $15,000
Large PSV	$12,000 – $22,000
CSV (Specialized)	$35,000 – $50,000
Marine Gas Oil	$600 – $800 / tonne

Port & Handling Costs (Macaé)

* Fixed Costs (Per Call): $1,450 – $3,250 (Pilotage, Agency, Base Fees).
* Variable Handling: $5 – $10 per m³ (Liquids); $15 – $30 per tonne (Deck Cargo).

Production Loss Impact (Daily/Hourly)

Metric / Asset	Financial Loss (USD)
Network Hourly Downtime	$218,600 / hour
FPSO Valente (Frade)	$1,838,400 / day
FPSO Peregrino	$1,833,600 / day
FPSO Forte	$1,056,000 / day
Polvo Cluster	$518,400 / day

To safeguard these margins, PRIO has integrated AI to transition from reactive to predictive logistical modeling.

7. Digital Integration: AI-Driven Predictive Maintenance

The partnership with Shape Digital facilitates a shift to predictive maintenance, directly reducing the frequency of "Emergency Supply Runs," which carry significantly higher costs than scheduled milk runs.
