**Verification Approach:**
Where possible, information has been cross-referenced across multiple independent sources. Key operational metrics (production capacities, distances, transaction values) are sourced directly from company announcements or regulatory filings. Technical specifications for subsea infrastructure and vessel operations are sourced from contractor announcements and industry publications.

**Limitations:**
Some detailed operational procedures and specific logistics arrangements remain proprietary to PRIO and its contractors. This report relies on publicly available information and industry-standard practices where specific PRIO data is not disclosed.

**Suggested Citation:**

### Data Verification and Accuracy Notes

**Fact-Checking Process (January 2026):**
This report underwent comprehensive fact-checking to verify all quantitative claims and technical specifications. Key corrections made based on primary source verification include:

1. **FPSO Forte Processing Capacity:** Corrected from initially inflated estimate to verified 180,000 barrels of oil per day (Source: OnePetro OTC-18242-MS, PRIO corporate filings).

2. **Wahoo Tieback Distance:** Confirmed as approximately 30 kilometers based on multiple contractor sources (McDermott, Prysmian) and IBAMA licensing documents. Described as "one of Brazil's longest rigid pipeline tiebacks" rather than definitively "Brazil's longest" to account for other major tieback projects in the Santos and Campos basins.

3. **Polvo Production Figures:** Clarified that 8,000 bpd refers to historical production levels during early PRIO operations; current cluster production (Polvo + Tubarão Martelo) operates at approximately 15,000-16,000 boe/d combined.

4. **FPSO Valente (Frade) Processing Capacity:** Specified as 100,000 bpd based on PRIO development documentation.

All technical specifications, distances, production capacities, and transaction values have been cross-referenced with multiple independent sources including corporate press releases, regulatory filings, contractor announcements, and industry publications. Where conflicting information exists in sources, the most recent and authoritative source (typically regulatory filings or direct corporate disclosures) has been prioritized.
