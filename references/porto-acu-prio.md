Strategic Operational Report: PRIO’s Logistics Hub at Porto do Açu and the Prumo Partnership

1. Executive Context: The Strategic Convergence of PRIO and Porto do Açu

PRIO’s transformation into Brazil’s preeminent independent oil and gas producer is underscored by an aggressive growth trajectory, moving from a May 2025 production baseline of 99,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) toward a target approaching 200,000 boe/d by 2026. This scaling necessitates a fundamental shift in logistical architecture, transitioning from regional support to a large-scale export model centered at Porto do Açu. By aligning its production with infrastructure capable of handling the high-draught requirements of heavy crude, PRIO is positioning itself to lead the revitalization of the Campos Basin.

PRIO’s "Doing Things Differently" philosophy is realized through three core strategic pillars:

* Efficient Brownfield Optimization: Revitalizing mature, underperforming assets through technical innovation, exemplified by the successful 11km subsea tieback between the Polvo and Tubarão Martelo fields.
* Aggressive Operational Clustering: Integrating subsea infrastructure—such as the upcoming 30km Wahoo-Frade tieback—to utilize single processing hubs, eliminating redundant facilities and lowering the unit cost of production.
* Data-Driven Decision Intelligence: Employing advanced AI and predictive maintenance across the FPSO fleet to minimize unplanned downtime and maximize asset lifecycle.

Porto do Açu is the largest deep-water port complex in Latin America, currently managing 40% of Brazil’s national oil exports. The synergy between PRIO’s production surge—driven by the acquisition of 100% operatorship of the Peregrino field—and Açu’s 21.7-meter draught is a critical competitive lever. This infrastructure allows PRIO to utilize its "delivery to customer" model by loading Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs) at full capacity, providing the scale necessary for global market penetration.

This strategic alignment facilitates a shift from general offshore support to the specialized, high-capacity operational mechanics required for global energy exports.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. Deepwater Infrastructure: The Hub-and-Spoke Logistics Model

To sustain its expanding offshore footprint, PRIO utilizes a "Hub-and-Spoke" logistics model that integrates the established specialized services in Macaé with the deep-water capabilities of Porto do Açu. This decoupling of routine support from heavy export activities ensures that each port serves its most efficient purpose within the supply chain.

Feature	Macaé Support Base	Porto do Açu (Prumo)
Draught	7.9 meters	Up to 21.7 meters
Primary Function	Submarine engineering anchoring and specialized subsea services	Export, Transshipment, and VLCC Loading
Vessel Class Support	Platform Supply Vessels (PSV) / Tugs	VLCC, Suezmax, and Large CSVs
Strategic Role	Spoke: Specialized maintenance and crew transport	Hub: Global export engine and STS operations

The 21.7-meter draught at Porto do Açu is the primary driver of logistical cost reduction. Unlike shallower facilities, Açu permits the loading of VLCCs at full capacity without the need for costly and time-consuming lightering (ship-to-ship transfer to smaller vessels). By eliminating these bottlenecks, PRIO significantly reduces vessel wait times and avoids the prohibitive demurrage costs that often erode margins in heavy crude trading. This infrastructure is the physical foundation for PRIO's commercial strategy for heavy crude.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. The STS (Ship-to-Ship) Commercial Engine: Exporting Heavy Crude

Ship-to-Ship (STS) operations are both a technical and economic necessity for PRIO’s heavy oil portfolio, specifically the Peregrino field, which yields crude at 14° API. With a field break-even cost of approximately $35/barrel, commercial viability in a fluctuating price environment depends on high-efficiency transshipment and cargo consolidation at Porto do Açu.

PRIO optimizes its cargo through a structured three-step workflow:

1. Field Cluster Production: Crude is produced at the Southern Campos Cluster (Polvo/Tubarão Martelo) and the heavy oil hub at Peregrino.
2. Cargo Consolidation: Leveraging the 28km proximity between the Peregrino and Polvo/TBMT fields, PRIO consolidates cargoes into single offtake volumes reaching approximately 650,000 barrels.
3. STS Transshipment at Açu: Consolidated cargoes are transferred to larger export tankers (Suezmax/VLCC) at the Açu hub for international delivery.

This model underpins the Cathay Petroleum agreement, a 110,000 bpd "delivery to customer" contract. By utilizing Açu for STS transshipment, PRIO gains direct, cost-effective access to Asian refineries, transforming the company from a regional producer into a global midstream player.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. Contractual Ecosystem: Prumo Logística and Specialized Partners

Maintaining 24/7 offshore productivity requires a robust contractual network led by Prumo Logística and supported by specialized marine and digital partners. This ecosystem ensures that PRIO’s critical subsea architecture remains operational while production stops are minimized.

The Solstad Offshore partnership, valued at $100 million, provides the specialized marine assets required for expansion:

* CSV Normand Pioneer: A Construction Support Vessel utilized for trenching and subsea installation; it is the primary asset for the Wahoo tieback project.
* PSV Normand Carioca: A vessel converted for well stimulation and completion, essential for maintaining output in mature wells.

Beyond hardware, PRIO leverages high-frequency personnel transport through Omni Taxi Aéreo (utilizing AW139 helicopters from Macaé) and digital intelligence through Shape Digital.

The Strategic Impact: The "Shape Lighthouse" platform utilizes the sector’s largest proprietary offshore algorithm library, featuring over 200 AI models. This system is critical for mitigating failures in Electrical Submersible Pumps (ESPs), which historically suffer from short Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF). By predicting these failures before they occur, PRIO prevents catastrophic production stoppages at FPSOs Forte, Valente, and Bravo, preserving millions of dollars in revenue that would otherwise be lost to unplanned downtime.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. Performance Metrics and 2026 Growth Catalysts

The transition to 2026 represents a structural transformation for PRIO, driven by the consolidation of 100% operatorship at Peregrino and the completion of the Wahoo tieback.

Metric	2025 Forecast	2026 Target/Estimate
Daily Production	~110 kboe/d	~200 kboe/d
Consolidated Lifting Cost	$12.8/bbl*	$9.7/bbl
Key Strategic Project	Peregrino Operatorship Transfer	Wahoo Tieback (First Oil: March 2026)
Wahoo Lifting Cost	N/A	~$1/bbl
*Note: The 2025 lifting cost represents a temporary rise from the $9/bbl baseline in 2024, caused by technical stoppages and initial Peregrino integration; the 2026 target represents a return to form.		

The Peregrino Effect: The $3.5 billion acquisition of Equinor’s 60% stake and operatorship is a transformative catalyst. PRIO targets $250 million in annual efficiency gains at Peregrino by applying its proprietary operational model. A primary driver of this cost reduction is the energy transition from diesel-fired power to gas-fired power via the Petrobras Rota 2 pipeline. This shift, combined with the low-cost contribution of Wahoo (estimated at $1/bbl), will fundamentally alter PRIO’s cash flow generation by 2027.

In conclusion, the Porto do Açu-Prumo logistics corridor is the essential artery for PRIO’s evolution. By integrating deep-water draught, sophisticated STS consolidation, and AI-driven maintenance, PRIO is successfully scaling to become a 200,000+ bpd producer, redefining the potential of mature field optimization in the global energy market.
