# Project Context

## Purpose
Offshore Logistics Application - A system for managing logistics operations in offshore environments, including vessel tracking, cargo management, supply chain coordination, and operational planning for maritime and offshore industry operations.

## Tech Stack
- **To be determined** - Please specify your preferred stack:
  - Frontend: [React/Vue/Angular, TypeScript/JavaScript]
  - Backend: [Node.js/Python/Go/Java, framework]
  - Database: [PostgreSQL/MySQL/MongoDB]
  - Infrastructure: [Docker, cloud platform]

## Project Conventions

### Code Style
- Follow language-specific style guides (e.g., ESLint for JavaScript/TypeScript, Black/PEP 8 for Python)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Prefer explicit over implicit code
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Add comments for complex business logic

### Architecture Patterns
- **To be determined** - Please specify:
  - Monolith vs Microservices
  - API design (REST/GraphQL/gRPC)
  - Authentication/Authorization approach
  - Data access patterns (Repository, Active Record, etc.)

### Testing Strategy
- Write tests for critical business logic
- Include unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for key user workflows
- Maintain minimum code coverage threshold (TBD)

### Git Workflow
- Use feature branches for new work
- Commit messages should be clear and descriptive
- Use conventional commits format (optional): `type(scope): description`
- Create pull requests for review before merging
- Main/master branch should always be deployable

## Domain Context
- **Offshore Logistics**: Managing supply chains, cargo, and operations in maritime/offshore environments
- **Vessel Management**: Tracking ships, their locations, schedules, and cargo
- **Supply Chain**: Coordinating materials, equipment, and personnel to offshore locations
- **Operational Planning**: Scheduling, routing, and resource allocation for offshore operations
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Adherence to maritime regulations, safety standards, and environmental requirements

## Important Constraints
- **To be determined** - Please specify:
  - Performance requirements (response times, throughput)
  - Scalability needs (number of users, data volume)
  - Security requirements (data protection, access controls)
  - Regulatory compliance needs (maritime regulations, data privacy)
  - Integration requirements with existing systems

## External Dependencies
- **To be determined** - Please specify:
  - Vessel tracking APIs or services
  - Weather/maritime data providers
  - Payment processing (if applicable)
  - Email/SMS notification services
  - Mapping/GIS services
  - Third-party logistics platforms
